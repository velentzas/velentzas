In Summer 2022, I had the privilege of interning as an Economist for Redfin’s Economics and Research Analytics team. During these four months, I leveraged Redfin’s proprietary real-time housing data to provide comprehensive insights about the housing market for audiences inside and outside Redfin. Below, you can see a list of our published reports:

- [Inflation Rate for Millenial and Gen Z Renters](https://www.redfin.com/news/inflation-renters-gen-z-millennials-2022/)

- [Energy costs and mortgage expenses for the 50 most populous U.S. metropolitan areas](https://www.redfin.com/news/energy-costs-housing-2022/)

- [Housing Market Analysis of the U.S. metropolitan areas](https://www.redfin.com/news/housing-markets-cooling-fastest-bay-area-2022/)

    -Covered by [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/12/us-real-estate-markets-that-are-cooling-the-fastest.html), [Money.com](https://money.com/cities-housing-market-cooling-fastest/), [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brendarichardson/2022/08/04/housing-markets-that-show-signs-of-cooling-down-or-heating-up/?sh=368c725b1cd5)
