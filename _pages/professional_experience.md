In Summer 2022, I had the privilege of interning as an Economist for Redfin’s Economics and Research Analytics team. During these four months, I leveraged Redfin’s proprietary real-time housing data to provide comprehensive insights about the housing market for audiences inside and outside Redfin. Below, you can see a list of our published reports:

- [Inflation Rate for Millenial and Gen Z Renters](https://www.redfin.com/news/inflation-renters-gen-z-millennials-2022/)

- [Energy costs and mortgage expenses for the 50 most populous U.S. metropolitan areas](https://www.redfin.com/news/energy-costs-housing-2022/)

- [Housing Market Analysis of the U.S. metropolitan areas](https://www.redfin.com/news/housing-markets-cooling-fastest-bay-area-2022/)
